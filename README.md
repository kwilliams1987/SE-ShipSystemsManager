# Space Engineers: Ship Systems Manager
A Space Engineers script to automate block states, such as doors, lights and sound blocks based on certain conditions (such as decompression or enemies detected).

The script takes a snapshot of the state of all blocks which it has control over before the first time it edits them, allowing it to restore the blocks to default state when all states are cleared.

The script is completely automated, polling every 10 frames.

*It is possible, but not recommended, to run the script faster or slower.*

*Doing so will either cause excess performance impact, or reduce the speed at which the script can react to emergencies.*
## Special Thanks
Big shout out to [Malware](https://github.com/malware-dev) for his [Space Engineers Visual Studio Developers Kit](https://github.com/malware-dev/MDK-SE).

Without this I'd have never had the patience to go though with such an ambitious project!

# Work in Progress
Note that this script is still very, very work in progress and probably doesn't work at all yet.

More detailed information on setting up and customizing the script are available in the Wiki.
